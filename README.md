# Quarkus demo: Hibernate ORM with Panache and RESTEasy

[Launch in Dev Spaces](https://devspaces.apps.prime.pitt.ca/f?url=https://github.com/pittar-sandbox/quarkus-postgres-roo)

This is a minimal CRUD service exposing a couple of endpoints over REST,
with a front-end based on Angular so you can play with it from your browser.

Dev Spaces is pre-configured to install the [Roo Code](https://open-vsx.org/extension/RooVeterinaryInc/roo-cline) extension.
